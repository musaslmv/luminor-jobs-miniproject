# luminor-jobs-miniproject
Mini project for Luminor Job/Internship Application

Parts:

1- Web scrape - https://luminorbank.teamtailor.com/jobs\
2- Data Analysis via Tableau

**Project problem:** The process of job-search is time-consuming for an applicant.

**Project objective:** Automation process of position review from the applicant&#39;s perspective.

**Current situation:**

- An applicant searches through Luminor Career website for a position.
- Checks all position pages to find job requirements
- Compare job requirements to own skills
- Selects the best-fitted position and apply

**Solution (the product of the project) provides:**

- Check job descriptions through all positions
- Find similarity between job description and applicant&#39;s knowledge
- Creates DataFrame including:
  - job title
  - location
  - environment (hybrid/on-site/remote)
  - division of job
  - link to job application
  - similarity score

Similarity score – is the percentage of skills (pre-defined set of applicant&#39;s skills) that are fitted into job requirements.

**Data Analysis:**

Data Analysis part is done via Tableau, and it includes three worksheet within a dashboard:

- Division proportion - to understand which divisions are most demanded
- Remote opportunity proportion - to understand whether the environment is remote-friendly or not
- Opportunities by location - to understand which locations have more job openings

The main idea of mini project is to show several data&amp;analysis related skills for an application. Therefore, it does not involve any advanced software solutions – considering only a few hours are used to finish the project.

What can be done in the next steps? –

- GUI for an applicant (to add skills [pre-define], give input etc.)
- Similarity score can be calculated with more advanced algorithms (sentiment analysis can be done)
- Data correction (the variable for location is not always one location, it needs to be considered)
- Notifications to an applicant; when there is a new related position offer

The most activities are already done by Luminor, and interactivity is provided via dashboards.
